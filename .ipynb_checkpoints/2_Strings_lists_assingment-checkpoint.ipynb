    "Today we'll be working through problems designed to get your hands on everything you learned today - strings and lists (and their methods), along with iteration using for loops. The goal of today is to get more comfortable with Python, and working with its data structures. We're also going to work on getting more familiar with some of the methods that are available to us for interacting with strings and lists. Remember that from the IPython terminal, we can find any of the methods that are available on an object via tab completion. That should come in handy today!\n",

The starter code for these warm-up questions is located in the `warmups/` folder for this day. Feel free to edit the scripts in that folder in any way you need to solve these problems. Each question will ask you to add, remove, or change the code in the scripts. As you do so, run your scripts in order to test your changes. At the end of each change, your script should run from top to bottom, so make sure your aren't removing any code that it needs to run."
